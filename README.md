Prediction of the cleanliness of plates by photo

The model predicts if the plate is dirty or clean from the photo. If the prediction probability of the class is higher than 0.5, then the plate is dirty, otherwise it is clean. The retrained Resnet network is used. A train dataset consists of a very small quantity of plate's photos and the model predicts probabilities for a very large number of the plate's photos.
